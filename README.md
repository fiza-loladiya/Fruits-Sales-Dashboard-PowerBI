# 🍎 Fruits Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a **Fruits Sales Dashboard** built in **Power BI** as part of my data analytics learning journey.  
Main focus was on understanding **Average vs Total Sales**, implementing **YTD (Year-to-Date)** and **Running Total** for time-based analysis, and using **slicers** to make the report interactive and closer to real business reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
